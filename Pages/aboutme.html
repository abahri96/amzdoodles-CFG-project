                <p> Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where comics come to life and imagination knows no bounds! 
                    Here's a fun and quirky peek into the person behind the pen strokes and pixelated panels: </p>
                <p> Once upon a time, in a world not too different from our own, a curious soul nicknamed Amz decided to embark on a wild artistic adventure. Armed with a pencil that doubled as a magic wand and an imagination that could rival a hyperactive squirrel, Amz dove headfirst into the realm of doodles and comics, ready to create stories that would tickle your funny bone and tug at your heartstrings.</p>
                <p> Amz is a certified daydreamer and a self-proclaimed "caffeine-powered drawing machine. You'll often find them huddled over a sketchbook, on a never-ending quest for the perfect punchline.
                
                    With a heart full of puns and a brain buzzing with whimsy, Amz is on a mission to spread laughter and joy, one doodle at a time. </p>
                <p> When not immersed in the mystical world of comics, Amz can be found roaming the hospital corridors in her day job as a doctor or exploring the vast landscapes of the world on her time off. They are an expert in binge-watching entire TV series in record time, and a connoisseur of all things geeky (she coded her own website here!). </p>
                <p> So buckle up, dear visitor, and get ready for a wild ride through the extraordinary mind of amz. Join them on this whimsical adventure and life experiences, where laughter is the secret ingredient to resilience, and imagination is the key that unlocks the door to a world where anything and everything is possible. </p>
                <p>Stay weird and keep smiling,
                    amzdoodles </p>
